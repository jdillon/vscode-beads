{"id":"vsbeads-zkc","title":"Test: code-server for native macOS dev with bd socket access","description":"Test code-server (Coder) running natively on macOS for vscode-beads development.\n\n## Motivation\n- openvscode-server only available via Docker on macOS\n- Docker isolation blocks bd daemon socket access\n- code-server runs natively, should have full socket access\n\n## Setup\n```bash\nbrew install code-server\ncode-server --bind-addr localhost:8080\n```\n\n## Test Plan\n1. Install code-server via brew\n2. Start on localhost:8080\n3. Install vscode-beads VSIX\n4. Verify Beads panel connects to bd daemon\n5. Test Chrome DevTools MCP integration\n6. Document CLI options for extension management\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Extension loads\n- Webviews work  \n- bd daemon socket connects (no ECONNREFUSED)\n- Issues display in panel","notes":"## Results - SUCCESS ✅\n\n### Setup\n```bash\nbrew install code-server\ncode-server --bind-addr localhost:8080 --auth none /path/to/project\n```\n\n### CLI Extension Management\n```bash\ncode-server --install-extension /path/to/extension.vsix\ncode-server --list-extensions\n```\n\n### Test Results\n- ✅ VS Code loads in browser at localhost:8080\n- ✅ Extension installs via CLI\n- ✅ Extension loads after reload + trust folder\n- ✅ Beads tab appears in activity bar\n- ✅ Webviews render correctly\n- ✅ **bd daemon socket connects** (no ECONNREFUSED!)\n- ✅ Issues list displays all 26 issues\n- ✅ Filter controls, project selector work\n\n### Why It Works\ncode-server runs natively on macOS, so it has direct access to the Unix socket at `.beads/bd.sock`. No Docker isolation.\n\n### Dev Workflow\n1. `bun run watch` (local rebuild)\n2. `bun run package` (create VSIX)\n3. `code-server --install-extension vscode-beads-*.vsix`\n4. DevTools MCP: \"Developer: Reload Window\"\n5. Test extension in browser\n\n### Comparison vs OpenVSCode Server (Docker)\n| Feature | code-server | OpenVSCode Server |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Install | `brew install` | Docker only on macOS |\n| bd socket | ✅ Works | ❌ Docker isolation |\n| CLI install | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Webviews | ✅ | ✅ |\n\n**Winner: code-server** for vscode-beads development on macOS.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-27T17:57:42.397471-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T17:59:55.75636-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-27T17:59:55.75636-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"vsbeads-zkc","depends_on_id":"vsbeads-3cn","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-27T18:50:55.146686-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
