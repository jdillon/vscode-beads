{"id":"vsbeads-3ly3","title":"Hierarchical IDs create implicit parent-child not exposed by daemon API","notes":"## Summary\nHierarchical bead IDs (`\u003cparent-id\u003e.\u003cN\u003e`) create an **implicit** parent-child relationship based on ID naming convention. This implicit relationship:\n1. Is NOT exposed through the daemon API\n2. Blocks adding explicit `parent-child` dependencies\n3. Results in \"orphaned\" parent-child relationships invisible to vscode-beads\n\n## Reproduction\n```bash\n# Create parent\nbd create --title=\"Parent\" --type=epic\n# Output: vsbeads-515e\n\n# Create child with --parent (works correctly - adds BOTH hierarchical ID AND explicit dep)\nbd create --title=\"Child\" --type=task --parent=vsbeads-515e\n# Output: vsbeads-515e.1 (hierarchical ID)\n# Also adds explicit parent-child dependency record\n\n# Try to manually add parent-child dep (BLOCKED)\nbd dep add vsbeads-515e.1 vsbeads-515e --type=parent-child\n# Error: cannot add dependency: vsbeads-515e.1 is already a child of vsbeads-515e.\n# Children inherit dependency on parent completion via hierarchy.\n# Adding an explicit dependency would create a deadlock\n```\n\n## Root Cause\nThe `isChildOf()` function checks if an ID follows hierarchical pattern (`parent.N`):\n- If true, blocks adding explicit `parent-child` dependency (bd-nim5 fix)\n- But daemon API doesn't synthesize this implicit relationship in dependency queries\n- vscode-beads only sees explicit dependencies from daemon\n\n## Upstream Code References\n| File | Line | Function | Purpose |\n|------|------|----------|---------|\n| `cmd/bd/dep.go` | 30 | `isChildOf()` | Checks if ID follows hierarchical pattern |\n| `cmd/bd/dep.go` | 142-146 | dep add | Blocks child→parent deps with deadlock error |\n| `internal/rpc/server_labels_deps_comments.go` | 15-24 | `isChildOf()` | Same check in daemon RPC |\n| `internal/rpc/server_labels_deps_comments.go` | 35-42 | `DepAdd()` | Daemon-side blocking |\n| `internal/storage/sqlite/ids.go` | 44-64 | `IsHierarchicalID()` | Parses hierarchical IDs |\n| `internal/storage/sqlite/ids.go` | 70-91 | `ParseHierarchicalID()` | Extracts parent ID and child number |\n\n## Impact\n- Issues imported with hierarchical IDs (e.g., from Linear) may lack explicit dependencies\n- Parent-child relationships invisible in vscode-beads UI\n- Cannot manually fix by adding dependency (blocked)\n- Dependency display shows \"-\" for parent/children columns\n\n## Possible Solutions\n1. **Upstream fix**: Daemon API should synthesize implicit parent-child from hierarchical IDs\n2. **vscode-beads workaround**: Parse hierarchical IDs client-side to infer relationships\n3. **Data migration**: Script to add missing explicit deps for existing hierarchical IDs\n\n## Related\n- bd-nim5: Original fix that added the blocking behavior\n- GH#728: Child counter updates for explicit child IDs\n- `bd doctor --fix-child-parent`: Opt-in fix for child→parent deps","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"jdillon","created_at":"2025-12-27T20:50:53.075865-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T11:36:24.070757-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T11:36:24.070757-08:00","close_reason":"Testing shows mechanism works correctly.

Children inherit dependency via hierarchy.\"\n2. **May not be reflected in daemon/UI** - The implicit relationship from ID naming may not be exposed through the daemon API, so vscode-beads can't display it\n\n## How Hierarchical IDs Work (upstream beads)\n- When creating with `--parent`, `bd create` does TWO things:\n  1.

Adds explicit `parent-child` type dependency\n- The `isChildOf()` function in `dep.go` and `server_labels_deps_comments.go` checks if an ID follows the hierarchical pattern\n- Fix bd-nim5 added validation to prevent \"deadlock\" from explicit deps on implicit relationships\n\n## Key Code Locations (upstream)\n- `cmd/bd/dep.go:30` - `isChildOf()` function\n- `cmd/bd/dep.go:142-146` - Check that blocks child→parent deps\n- `internal/rpc/server_labels_deps_comments.go:15-24` - Same check in daemon\n- `internal/storage/sqlite/ids.go:44-64` - `IsHierarchicalID()` parsing\n\n## Impact on vscode-beads\nIf issues have hierarchical IDs but the daemon doesn't expose the implicit parent-child relationship:\n- Parent/child won't show in dependency display\n- Can't manually add the relationship (blocked)\n- Possible data inconsistency\n\n## Investigation Needed\n- Check if daemon returns implicit hierarchy in dependency queries\n- Verify how Linear imports or other sources create hierarchical IDs\n- Determine if this is an upstream beads issue or vscode-beads display issue","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-27T20:46:41.636091-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T20:51:17.967887-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T20:51:17.967887-08:00","close_reason":"Superseded by vsbeads-3ly3 (P0 with full details)","labels":["backend","daemon"]}
